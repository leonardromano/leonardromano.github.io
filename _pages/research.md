My research focuses on dynamical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM).   

During my M.Sc., I implemented state-of-the-art models for dust grain-size evolution for galaxy-scale simulations into the **Gadget4-Osaka** code and coupled them to molecular chemistry.   

Currently, I am finishing up my PhD, where I introduced the **SISSI project**, featuring numerical zoom-in simulations of superbubbles in the ISM of a simulated isolated Milky-Way-like galaxy to study how their dynamics are influenced by their turbulent galactic environment.   

Moving forward, I am planning to build on my expertise with grain-size evolution models and HPC applications to study the **survival of dust and molecules under extreme conditions**, such as those encountered in supernova remnants and the circumgalactic medium.   

Stay tuned to find out what's next!
