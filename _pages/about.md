Hi! I’m Leonard Romano, a doctoral researcher at the University Observatory Munich.

My research focuses on dynamical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). Currently, I am finishing up my PhD, where I used numerical zoom-in simulations of superbubbles in the ISM of a simulated isolated Milky-Way-like galaxy to study how their dynamics are influenced by their turbulent galactic environment. If you are interested, please check out my [thesis](/files/PhD_thesis.pdf). This research was supported by the ORIGINS cluster of excellence.
Moving forward, I am planning to build on my expertise with grain-size evolution models and HPC applications to answer the pertinent question of how dust and molecules can survive under extreme multiphase conditions, such as those encountered in supernova remnants and the circumgalactic medium.

You can find my [CV](/files/CV.pdf), recent [publications](/publications/), and links to the [software tools](/software/) and [visualizations](/visualizations/) I’ve developed throughout the project.

Feel free to get in touch via email or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/leonardromano) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KA6zJ5EAAAAJ&hl).

My current email address starts with "lromano", ends with "usm.lmu.de" both connected via the standard "@" sign.
