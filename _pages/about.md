I am a doctoral researcher at the [University Observatory Munich](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/) (USM), Garching, which I joined under through funding from the [ORIGINS Cluster of Excellence](https://www.origins-cluster.de/) at [Ludwig Maximilians University](https://www.lmu.de/en/) (LMU), Munich.

I am part of [Dr. Manuel Behrendt](https://www.manuelbehrendt.com/)'s PGN Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main) (MPE), a subgroup of [Prof. Andreas Burkert](https://www.andreasburkert.com/)'s [Computational Astrophysics](https://www.usm.lmu.de/CAST/wp/) (CAST) group at USM.

My broad research interest is Computational Astrophysics. To be more specific, I work with numerical simulations to study the behaviour of galaxies and the environments they host.

## Background

I am natively from the state of [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria) in Germany. During my early years, I lived in and near [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich) going to school in the suburbian town of [Gröbenzell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6benzell), where I lived until I went away for an exchange semester in [Osaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka) in 2018, which motivated me to move out and establish my own place.

While I completed my (under-) graduate studies near my home town at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) (TUM) in [Garching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garching), I gained most of my research experience from research that I did at [Osaka University](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Kentaro Nagamine](https://astro-osaka.jp/kn/).   
The [Nuclear-, Particle- & Astrophysics](https://academics.nat.tum.de/en/msc/ph/kta) program at TUM notably focuses mostly on particle physics, so I received an unusual amount of training on topics like path integrals, symmetry groups and field theories; considering that I ultimately ended up in astrophysics.   

During the [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) it became difficult to travel so I opted for a position for my Doctoral Studies at the USM Munich.

## What Else?

When I’m not modeling SNRs or exploding :bomb::bomb::bomb: in simulated galaxies, I have some hobbies that I engage with. My hobbies include **breadmaking**, **swimming**, **lasertag** and **hiking** in the nearby Bavarian Alps.   
I also spend some of my free-time on side-projects such as learning all there is about **filing US-taxes from abroad** or building an [automatic converter](https://github.com/leonardromano/mrxs2tiff) between different microscope output formats -- topics that my tremendously helped my wife.
