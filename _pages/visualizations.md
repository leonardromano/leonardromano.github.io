### ðŸŒ€ SISSI -- Supernovae in a Shearing, Stratified Interstellar Medium

![Superbubble simulation](../images/sissi_sb_3d.gif)

A 3D rendering of the simulated superbubble #22 (N1) from the **SISSI** simulation, showcased in the first [SISSI paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250312977R/abstract). The geometry of the superbubble after 10 Myr of expansion into the complex ISM of the SISSI galaxy is shown.   
This visualization was generated using [paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).

The animation illustrates the complex interaction between feedback-driven shells and their surrounding ISM, highlighting the role of galactic scale effects, such as galactic shear and tidal forces from local substructures.
