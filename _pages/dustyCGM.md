Galaxies are full of violent events — exploding stars, powerful winds, and turbulent gas flows. These extreme environments might seem like the last place you'd find something as fragile as dust or molecules. And yet, we keep detecting them — even in the hot, chaotic outskirts of galaxies and within supernova remnants.

This project explores a big question:  
**How do dust and molecules survive under such harsh conditions?**

Dust and molecular gas are essential ingredients in the life cycle of galaxies. They help form stars, cool hot gas, and even shape what we see when we observe galaxies through telescopes. But we still don’t fully understand how they manage to survive when surrounded by heat, radiation, and turbulence.

To investigate this mystery, I plan to use advanced computer simulations to recreate these extreme cosmic environments. I’ll model how dust grains and molecules interact with their surroundings — how they’re destroyed, how they might reform, and under what conditions they can persist.

By combining high-performance computing with detailed physical models, this project aims to answer:

- What physical processes allow dust and molecules to survive in the most extreme corners of space?  
- What kinds of environments are most hostile — or most protective — to these particles?  
- How can we connect simulation results to real observations from telescopes?
