### ðŸ§© Developed Software

#### **Osaka-Gadget4**
A modified version of **Gadget-4** tailored for high-resolution simulations of galactic environments, developed in collaboration with [Y. Oku](https://www.yurioku.com/) and K. Matsumoto.

Key features include:
- A dust grain-size evolution model  
- Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) physics module  
- State-of-the-art stellar feedback models  
- Numerous upgrades and patches to core SPH routines in Gadget-4  

ðŸ”’ **Repository access is currently restricted** due to data sharing policies. Available to collaborators upon request.

### ðŸ”§ Contributions to Open-Source Projects

#### **Grackle-3 (v3.2)**  
Chemistry and cooling library used in astrophysical simulations.  
Contributed new options for **dust and Hâ‚‚ physics**.

- Pull Request: [PR #94](https://github.com/grackle-project/grackle/pull/94)  
- Repository: [github.com/grackle-project/grackle](https://github.com/grackle-project/grackle)

#### **RAMSES**  
Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code for hydrodynamic simulations.

- Fixed a scalar advection error in the hydrodynamics module  
- Commit: [f1bd65e](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses/commits/f1bd65e)
